# Elements of reproducinility ----
# Analytic data
# Analytic code
# Documentation
# Distribution

# Literate Statistical Programming - The text is readable by people and the code is readable by computers
library(knitr) # is a package that builds on the work of Sweave and provides much more powerful functionality, including the ability to write in Markdown and create a variety of output formats.

# Structure of data analysis ----

# • Cleaning the data
# • Exploratory data analysis
# • Statistical prediction/modeling

# • Creating reproducible code

# Organizing data files ----

# Raw and processed data
# Exploratory figures - serve the role of giving you a quick look at various aspects of your data.
# Final figures
# Scripts - raw and final
# R markdown files - review on report-writing-in-R.pdf
# Readme files - if you dont use R markdown
# Final report

# Coding standards for R ----
# 1.- Always write your code using a text editor and save as a text file
# 2.- Indent your code
# 3.- Limit the with of your code to 80 columns
# 4.- Limit the lenght of a function, keep it simple

# Markdown ----
# is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)
