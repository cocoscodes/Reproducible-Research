My First Markdown File
======================
This is the first R markdown document

Here we will load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
````

Let's make the first pair plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
````

Here is a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
````

Here is an unordered list  
* First item  
* Second item
